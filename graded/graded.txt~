Grade: B+

There's a lot of good here, but for some reason, the test programs
complete but silently produce no output.  The design needs a
refactoring, which you note, and there's some excess bit manipulation
that is not quite right but probably harmless.

If you had left yourself a little more time, this would have been
really good.
